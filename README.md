## Known Issues

During the development of the Country Explorer application, I encountered an issue where the data was not displaying correctly on the next page of results when using pagination. 

### Issue Details
- **Description**: When attempting to view additional data, the next page of countries was not loading as expected.
- **Cause**: The issue was identified as a problem with the API call not properly fetching the next set of results due to incorrect pagination parameters.

### Solution
To resolve this issue, I made the following changes:
1. **Corrected Pagination Logic**: Adjusted the logic in the code to ensure that the API call included the correct parameters for pagination.
2. **Improved State Management**: Ensured that the application correctly tracked the current page state and updated it after each API call.
3. **Added Error Handling**: Implemented error handling to display meaningful messages when data could not be loaded, providing a better user experience.

After these adjustments, the pagination feature now works as intended, allowing users to load and view the next set of countries seamlessly.
